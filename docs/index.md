## Why we should be a finalist?

We implemented a JavaScript framework for calculating the layout for large-scale graphs in the web platform. We use the GLSL on WebGL to do general purpose computation for the graph layout algorithm.

This is a significant feature for data scientists, artists, journalists who would to visualize and analysis large-scale graph efficiently in an interactive manner. They want to access it across all platforms by just opening a webpage, instead of installing a software like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

### Major Technical Challenges
- WebGL is not designed for general computing.
### Preliminary Result
### Plan for Friday

## Contibutors
- Tao Lin (<tlin2@andrew.cmu.edu>)
- Bowei Chen (<boweic@andrew.cmu.edu>)
