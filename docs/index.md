## TITLE

Please provide the title of your project, followed by the names of all team members. Teams may include up to two students. There are no exceptions to this rule.

## SUMMARY
Summarize your project in no more than 2-3 sentences. Describe what you plan to do and what parallel systems you will be working with. Example one-liners include (you should add a bit more detail):

We are going to implement an optimized Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics fluid solver on the NVIDIA GPUs in the lab.
We are going port the Go runtime to Blacklight.
We are going to create optimized implementations of sparse-matrix multiplication on both GPU and multi-core CPU platforms, and perform a detailed analysis of both systems' performance characteristics.
We are going to back-engineer the unpublished machine specifications of the GPU in the tablet my partner just purchased.
We are going to implement two possible algorithms for a real-time computer vision application on a mobile device and measure their energy consumption in the lab.
